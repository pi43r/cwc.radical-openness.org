          Conversations with Computers is a 2-day Symposium organized by the net
          culture initiative servus.at in cooperation with the Department of
          Time-based Media of the University of Art and Design Linz. The
          symposium addresses contemporary artistic research in the field of AI,
          focusing on new languages that emerge between humans and machines, but
          also how work and communication are facilitated through technological
          means.
          <br />
          When we talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning today,
          we must not forget the enormous amount of human labor that is hidden
          in seemingly autonomous systems. Behind every computer program are an
          immense amount of people who make it possible, and whose presence, in
          most cases, stays hidden behind the interface. Moreover, these AI
          systems are built upon an extractivist logic that inherits and
          reproduces harmful social biases in their statistical weights.
          Artists, critical designers, and researchers are playing a central
          role in excavating AI systems by exposing the work that flows into the
          creation of large datasets and their refinement. <br />
          By stepping back and exploring the codes and symbols we use to create
          instructions for machines, artists and programmers are fundamentally
          questioning the desire for efficiency embedded within the act of
          programming computers. What is discussed under the label of 'Esoteric
          programming languages' breaks away from the norms of computing and
          create novel languages and styles with strange syntax and twisted
          logic. Within these fringes of programming languages, we can find a
          desire to untangle and obfuscate the building blocks of human-computer
          interaction, while critical code studies are articulating discourse
          around feminist, decolonial, indigenous, and queer approaches to AI
          and the Human. <br />
          With forthcoming large language models, new conversational agents are
          emerging, which distill scraped websites into stochastic parrots. They
          lead to advancements, which enable more natural forms of interaction
          between humans and computers. <br />
          A look into the future suggests that we will soon be living with
          anthropomorphized computers, which are designed with an obedient
          personality that mimics empathy and emotion. Current models of voice
          computer interfaces already simulate personalities to gain a user’s
          trust. Designers are optimizing for approachability, efficiency, and
          by all means, to avoid friction. Yet, at the fringes of computation,
          we can find points of friction, and exploitation, but also new
          experiments and poetic communication. <br />
          Taking examples from esolangs and analytical design practices, how do
          we envision new critical interfaces between humans and machines? How
          do we navigate through our increasingly computational environments
          with our silicon-based friends?

              <p class="tt-abstract">
                While computing finally has become ubiquitous, it has fragmented
                as well. Today, it appears in countless forms, pretending to be
                usable, tangible, intelligent, natural, and human. At the same
                time, user behavior is becoming increasingly indistinguishable
                from computation. Humans appear as software extensions, as
                appendages to machines. On the other hand, the stunning
                achievements of computation themselves often turn out to be
                forms of hidden human labor. If we assume that it is indeed
                “computers all the way down” it might be time to ask what a
                computer actually is – and to return to the roots of the term.

                The premise of automation and a post-work future seems
                irresistible. While the automation discourse steers in the
                direction of technological inevitability and the replacement of
                human work, its underlying infrastructures expose a very
                different picture. This talk reflects on the hidden labour
                within computational systems and critically explores the
                narrative of automation's technocratic fantasies, which hides
                the human and their labour behind a precisely positioned
                technological determinism, trying to draw them obsolete. The
                accompanied works find great inspiration within the field of
                digital anthropology and take a cultural approach: they treat
                the lived experiences of people involved in the production of
                necessary datasets and automated engagement as the subject for
                theorising the complicated structures of contemporary digital
                capital.

                Conrad Weise is a Cologne/Cluj based artist and researcher. In
                his work he looks at socio-political settings where he locates
                computation and its implications. Through investigative and
                computational approaches from within these systems, his works
                attempt to contextualise the intransparent and uncertain
                arrangements. His current research focuses in particular on the
                hidden labour and automated engagement within computational
                systems.

                Imagine it's 2040, and you are living together in a
                collaborative network of diverse digital entities. The project
                "How are you, my digital friend?" investigates the possibilities
                of inscribing the "vibrant matter" (Bennet, 2020) of "emotions"
                (Damasio, 2011) in a socio-technical interface in HCI. Living
                and working in coexistence with digital actants means that we
                begin an intimate relationship with them. In this fiction,
                digital actants can show us their emotion and react emotionally
                to a particular situation. Emotions are part of the human
                experience and play a significant role in our life, (maybe) even
                more extensive than the rational one.
                <br />
                According to the repertoire of the emotional digital machines,
                the interaction can vary greatly. A subtle-dominant thing is
                more likely to show its anger and rage if faced with an
                unpleasant situation. In contrast, a submissive-friendly thing
                is more likely to react anxiously to the same problem. The
                emotional repertoire of a thing and the definition of emotional
                triggers/appeals involves inscribing cultural values and
                socio-political aspects.
                <br />
                What sorts of emotions/moods are relevant for interaction in the
                coexistence of humans and machines?

              </div>
              <p class="tt-abstract">
                A big number of audiences online nowadays is mainly algorithms.
                Algorithms are trained on the auditory information, that is
                produced and uploaded by humans. In the video 'Not allowed for
                algorithmic audiences', an Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA),
                situated in the extremely hot city of Athens in Greece, exhibits
                an odd behavior.
                <br />
                They borrow an avatar and appear before their users. For a brief
                period of time, for seven consecutive days before they shut down
                for ever and end up in an e-waste, the IPA goes into seven
                monologues. During their length of operation, they have managed
                to scan the entire contents of the Internet and gather all sorts
                of information, information that they long to share. The IPA
                uses their seven brief monologues as an opportunity to introduce
                themselves, talk about their skills, their ancestors, their
                anatomy and origins, and about voice and its significance. They
                reveal data regarding the listening infrastructure as well as
                the social dysfunctions on which their programming and operation
                are based. Just before they reach the end of their monologues,
                in a final effort to reconcile humans and machines, they share
                tips with humans on how they can manage… not to be heard by
                algorithms.
                <br />
                In her project, Kyriaki Goni, integrates in a fictional
                narrative the current wealth of research on artificial
                intelligence and voice interfaces, as well as the relationship
                between humans and machines. Listening infrastructures,
                surveillance and climate crisis are as well part of this
                narration. Could poetics be a way for us to understand the
                machines? Can we de-bias the training processes? Is it possible
                to make kin with the machines?

                Deliberately weird programming languages made their first
                appearance in the 70’s, when many of the computational concepts
                and paradigms taken for granted today were still being formed
                and explored. Today, even though there is a wide variety of
                programming languages available, only a small fraction of them
                explores what is beyond the conformant models of what could be
                considered our day-to-day human-computer interaction, usually
                because their highly experimental and challenging qualities
                prevents them from being introduced to a larger public or
                incorporated by the software industry.
                <br />
                This niche but prolific community introduces programmers,
                artists, computer scientists, linguists and the curious to new
                possibilities that challenge and subvert the preconceived
                notions of high-performant, westernized, and English-spoken
                rules of computation, incessantly pushing the boundaries on the
                limits of computation, representation and logic systems,
                inspiring us to see how radically different computation could
                have been – and may become - with the interesting languages that
                are yet to be found.

                Esolangs are experiential art: the nature of a language is
                revealed by programs exploring its logic and eccentricities. So
                it seems very odd to deliberately create an esolang that has no
                valid programs. Yet there are many esolangs that exist as pure
                idea-art; those that can run only in our heads. These include
                self-contradictory rulesets, ambiguous languages, or perfectly
                well-defined ones that only run on computers that break the
                physical laws of our universe. By refusing to acquiesce to
                runnability, these esolang offer the sharpest critique of how we
                define language, code, and computer.

              <p class="tt-abstract">
                Contemporary computer art is smooth — from the characteristic
                look and transformations of GANs to the ongoing pursuit of
                higher resolutions and faster processes. In this way, even
                critical art’s aesthetics can serve support the ideology of AI
                as all-seeing facilitator of a better future, rather than as the
                bias-laundering facilitator of a brutal capitalism — one in
                which the actual is subsumed by the probable. This talk will
                briefly outline examples of the former before considering
                optional ways to work with computers that reveal their weak
                points and limitations, and reconfigure the relationship between
                machines and people away from the current
                mechanization-as-progress teleology.

                Ekheo is a duo, formed by Aude Langlois and Belinda Sykora, that
                explores the crosslines of the musical, visual and sonic art of
                performance. Equipped with synthesizers, microphones,
                instruments and projectors, Ekheo creates a transcendent and
                dreamlike ambient, that drags viewers and listeners onto a
                psychedelic trip and expands one's perception of sound and
                vision. Each performance is unique, since improvisation,
                adaption to surroundings and communication between each other is
                key to the world of Ekheo. Nonetheless, there is an overall
                thread and distinctive approach, that carries each performance.
                They are occasionally joined by the jamaican-born and New
                York-raised Rodger Brown, who works as a multidimensional artist
                in Berlin and takes care of the visual aspect of Ekheo.  Aude
                and Belinda met at university, while studying “Sound Studies” at
                the Berlin UdK (Universität der Künste). They are both dedicated
                and experienced musicians, that focus on interdisciplinary art.
                Although they are both multi-faceted artists, Belinda focusses
                on binaural sound walks, sound installations, radio plays and
                performances, while Aude works on the interceptions of music,
                sound design and technology. Before they met, Belinda was a
                studied actress in Vienna, while Aude finished “Music and
                Musicology” at the Sorbonne University in Paris. This concert is
                the sonic trace of the silicon friend camp and our ongoing
                research about the voice, improvisational music and AI.

            ZBM 4.OG “Serving sounds” - A listening session and compositional
            workshop with Ekheo The server room is a place carrying other
            seemingly endless digital spaces. We can experience it as a trace of
            online files and data it stores. How does this mysteriously layered
            space sound? Is there a way to give it a sonic materiality through
            the way we listen to it? This is what we would like to attempt with
            you in this workshop. Divided in two parts, we will do a guided
            listening session in the morning and produce a collective sonic
            composition in the afternoon. <br />
            What do you need? For the morning listening session: Paper and pens
            of your choice For the Afternoon production session: A computer with
            a DAW and headphones (audacity is free for mac and windows)
