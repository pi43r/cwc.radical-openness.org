          Conversations with Computers is a 2-day Symposium organized by the net
          culture initiative servus.at in cooperation with the Department of
          Time-based Media of the University of Art and Design Linz. The
          symposium addresses contemporary artistic research in the field of AI,
          focusing on new languages that emerge between humans and machines, but
          also how work and communication are facilitated through technological
          means.
          <br />
          When we talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning today,
          we must not forget the enormous amount of human labor that is hidden
          in seemingly autonomous systems. Behind every computer program are an
          immense amount of people who make it possible, and whose presence, in
          most cases, stays hidden behind the interface. Moreover, these AI
          systems are built upon an extractivist logic that inherits and
          reproduces harmful social biases in their statistical weights.
          Artists, critical designers, and researchers are playing a central
          role in excavating AI systems by exposing the work that flows into the
          creation of large datasets and their refinement. <br />
          By stepping back and exploring the codes and symbols we use to create
          instructions for machines, artists and programmers are fundamentally
          questioning the desire for efficiency embedded within the act of
          programming computers. What is discussed under the label of 'Esoteric
          programming languages' breaks away from the norms of computing and
          create novel languages and styles with strange syntax and twisted
          logic. Within these fringes of programming languages, we can find a
          desire to untangle and obfuscate the building blocks of human-computer
          interaction, while critical code studies are articulating discourse
          around feminist, decolonial, indigenous, and queer approaches to AI
          and the Human. <br />
          With forthcoming large language models, new conversational agents are
          emerging, which distill scraped websites into stochastic parrots. They
          lead to advancements, which enable more natural forms of interaction
          between humans and computers. <br />
          A look into the future suggests that we will soon be living with
          anthropomorphized computers, which are designed with an obedient
          personality that mimics empathy and emotion. Current models of voice
          computer interfaces already simulate personalities to gain a user’s
          trust. Designers are optimizing for approachability, efficiency, and
          by all means, to avoid friction. Yet, at the fringes of computation,
          we can find points of friction, and exploitation, but also new
          experiments and poetic communication. <br />
          Taking examples from esolangs and analytical design practices, how do
          we envision new critical interfaces between humans and machines? How
          do we navigate through our increasingly computational environments
          with our silicon-based friends?

                    While computing finally has become ubiquitous, it has
                    fragmented as well. Today, it appears in countless forms,
                    pretending to be usable, tangible, intelligent, natural, and
                    human. At the same time, user behavior is becoming
                    increasingly indistinguishable from computation. Humans
                    appear as software extensions, as appendages to machines. On
                    the other hand, the stunning achievements of computation
                    themselves often turn out to be forms of hidden human labor.
                    If we assume that it is indeed “computers all the way down”
                    it might be time to ask what a computer actually is – and to
                    return to the roots of the term.

                    The premise of automation and a post-work future seems
                    irresistible. While the automation discourse steers in the
                    direction of technological inevitability and the replacement
                    of human work, its underlying infrastructures expose a very
                    different picture. This talk reflects on the hidden labour
                    within computational systems and critically explores the
                    narrative of automation's technocratic fantasies, which
                    hides the human and their labour behind a precisely
                    positioned technological determinism, trying to draw them
                    obsolete. The accompanied works find great inspiration
                    within the field of digital anthropology and take a cultural
                    approach: they treat the lived experiences of people
                    involved in the production of necessary datasets and
                    automated engagement as the subject for theorising the
                    complicated structures of contemporary digital capital.

                    Conrad Weise is a Cologne/Cluj based artist and researcher.
                    In his work he looks at socio-political settings where he
                    locates computation and its implications. Through
                    investigative and computational approaches from within these
                    systems, his works attempt to contextualise the
                    intransparent and uncertain arrangements. His current
                    research focuses in particular on the hidden labour and
                    automated engagement within computational systems.

                    Imagine it's 2040, and you are living together in a
                    collaborative network of diverse digital entities. The
                    project "How are you, my digital friend?" investigates the
                    possibilities of inscribing the "vibrant matter" (Bennet,
                    2020) of "emotions" (Damasio, 2011) in a socio-technical
                    interface in HCI. Living and working in coexistence with
                    digital actants means that we begin an intimate relationship
                    with them. In this fiction, digital actants can show us
                    their emotion and react emotionally to a particular
                    situation. Emotions are part of the human experience and
                    play a significant role in our life, (maybe) even more
                    extensive than the rational one.
                    <br />
                    According to the repertoire of the emotional digital
                    machines, the interaction can vary greatly. A
                    subtle-dominant thing is more likely to show its anger and
                    rage if faced with an unpleasant situation. In contrast, a
                    submissive-friendly thing is more likely to react anxiously
                    to the same problem. The emotional repertoire of a thing and
                    the definition of emotional triggers/appeals involves
                    inscribing cultural values and socio-political aspects.
                    <br />
                    What sorts of emotions/moods are relevant for interaction in
                    the coexistence of humans and machines?

                    A big number of audiences online nowadays is mainly
                    algorithms. Algorithms are trained on the auditory
                    information, that is produced and uploaded by humans. In the
                    video 'Not allowed for algorithmic audiences', an
                    Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA), situated in the
                    extremely hot city of Athens in Greece, exhibits an odd
                    behavior. They borrow an avatar and appear before their
                    users. For a brief period of time, for seven consecutive
                    days before they shut down for ever and end up in an
                    e-waste, the IPA goes into seven monologues. During their
                    length of operation, they have managed to scan the entire
                    contents of the Internet and gather all sorts of
                    information, information that they long to share. The IPA
                    uses their seven brief monologues as an opportunity to
                    introduce themselves, talk about their skills, their
                    ancestors, their anatomy and origins, and about voice and
                    its significance. They reveal data regarding the listening
                    infrastructure as well as the social dysfunctions on which
                    their programming and operation are based. Just before they
                    reach the end of their monologues, in a final effort to
                    reconcile humans and machines, they share tips with humans
                    on how they can manage… not to be heard by algorithms

                    across disciplines and technologies, she creates multimedia
                    installations. She connects the local with the global by
                    critically touching on questions of surveillance,
                    distributed networks and infrastructures, ecosystems, human
                    and other than human relations. Her works get exhibited
                    worldwide in solo and group shows. Recent solo shows were
                    presented at Onassis Cultural Centre, Athens; Aksioma,

                    Deliberately weird programming languages made their first
                    appearance in the 70’s, when many of the computational
                    concepts and paradigms taken for granted today were still
                    being formed and explored. Today, even though there is a
                    wide variety of programming languages available, only a
                    small fraction of them explores what is beyond the
                    conformant models of what could be considered our day-to-day
                    human-computer interaction, usually because their highly
                    experimental and challenging qualities prevents them from
                    being introduced to a larger public or incorporated by the
                    software industry.
                    <br />
                    This niche but prolific community introduces programmers,
                    artists, computer scientists, linguists and the curious to
                    new possibilities that challenge and subvert the
                    preconceived notions of high-performant, westernized, and
                    English-spoken rules of computation, incessantly pushing the
                    boundaries on the limits of computation, representation and
                    logic systems, inspiring us to see how radically different
                    computation could have been – and may become - with the
                    interesting languages that are yet to be found.

                    Mariana Marangoni is a Brazilian artist and researcher based
                    in London, whose work explores the materiality of media and
                    new forms of narrative. Her interdisciplinary practice takes
                    many forms, from web-based experiments to sculptural
                    installations. Recent work has been focused on critical
                    explorations of the Internet crisis, the aesthetics of decay
                    in digital media, and the potentialities of esoteric
                    programming languages in arborescent structures. She holds a
                    MA in Interaction Design at the London College of
                    Communication and is currently an Associate Lecturer at the

                    Esolangs are experiential art: the nature of a language is
                    revealed by programs exploring its logic and eccentricities.
                    So it seems very odd to deliberately create an esolang that
                    has no valid programs. Yet there are many esolangs that
                    exist as pure idea-art; those that can run only in our
                    heads. These include self-contradictory rulesets, ambiguous
                    languages, or perfectly well-defined ones that only run on
                    computers that break the physical laws of our universe. By
                    refusing to acquiesce to runnability, these esolang offer
                    the sharpest critique of how we define language, code, and
                    computer.

                    Contemporary computer art is smooth — from the
                    characteristic look and transformations of GANs to the
                    ongoing pursuit of higher resolutions and faster processes.
                    In this way, even critical art’s aesthetics can serve
                    support the ideology of AI as all-seeing facilitator of a
                    better future, rather than as the bias-laundering
                    facilitator of a brutal capitalism — one in which the actual
                    is subsumed by the probable. This talk will briefly outline
                    examples of the former before considering optional ways to
                    work with computers that reveal their weak points and
                    limitations, and reconfigure the relationship between
                    machines and people away from the current
                    mechanization-as-progress teleology.

                    Natalya Serkova recently suggested that we're seeing a trend
                    in the newest corners of the art world that tries to go
                    beyond the post-internet label. In my talk, I will try to
                    engage with her statement through the artistic practice of
                    Slovenian artist Matej Mihevc and his newest project
                    defnot_abot. In his project, Mihevc scrapes the images from
                    different Instagram artists associated with the
                    post-internet art, and then, in the second step, the
                    collected dataset is accessed by a generative adversarial
                    network (GAN) that through the established latent space
                    selects a random coordinate each day, from which the image
                    is generated and then published to the defnot_abot Instagram
                    account. I will argue that in Mihevc practice we see a
                    potential for a new kind of aesthetic expression, i.e. the
                    generic. I will try to substantiate this claim with
                    additional examples from Spotify and Balenciaga to Tzvetnik
                    curatorial practice and explain in what way are these
                    approaches different. How are they positioned in terms of
                    meaning making, intentionality, artistic expression and the
                    talk of the posthuman.

                    Ekheo is a duo, formed by Aude Langlois and Belinda Sykora,
                    that explores the crosslines of the musical, visual and
                    sonic art of performance. Equipped with synthesizers,
                    microphones, instruments and projectors, Ekheo creates a
                    transcendent and dreamlike ambient, that drags viewers and
                    listeners onto a psychedelic trip and expands one's
                    perception of sound and vision. Each performance is unique,
                    since improvisation, adaption to surroundings and
                    communication between each other is key to the world of
                    Ekheo. Nonetheless, there is an overall thread and
                    distinctive approach, that carries each performance. They
                    are occasionally joined by the jamaican-born and New
                    York-raised Rodger Brown, who works as a multidimensional
                    artist in Berlin and takes care of the visual aspect of
                    Ekheo.  Aude and Belinda met at university, while studying
                    “Sound Studies” at the Berlin UdK (Universität der Künste).
                    They are both dedicated and experienced musicians, that
                    focus on interdisciplinary art. Although they are both
                    multi-faceted artists, Belinda focusses on binaural sound
                    walks, sound installations, radio plays and performances,
                    while Aude works on the interceptions of music, sound design
                    and technology. Before they met, Belinda was a studied
                    actress in Vienna, while Aude finished “Music and
                    Musicology” at the Sorbonne University in Paris. This
                    concert is the sonic trace of the silicon friend camp and
                    our ongoing research about the voice, improvisational music
                    and AI.

          <p class="tt-abstract">
            The world is becoming littered with old mobile phone discarded as
            “upgrade” culture entices us to the shiny latest thing and obsolete
            Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets which turn into useless plastic
            bricks when their dependent cloud services go dark as the start-up
            fails and goes bankrupt.  In addition, while manufacturers are
            increasingly locking and securing the devices we have “purchased”,
            the right to repair movements aim to re-use these electronics in new
            and surprising ways.  The first step towards this culture of
            circular use is to be able to re-purpose a device for general
            purpose computation.  In this “hardware hacking” workshop, we will
            look at a typical IoT internet security camera and discover how to
            talk to it and re-program it for our own customised uses.  The
            spirit of this workshop is to also to generate ideas for an eventual
            system for combining discarded electronics into a re-usable general
            purpose computational system.  No previous hardware or software
            “hacking” experience is necessary for this step-by-step workshop,
            and all the necessary supplies will be provided.

            information aesthetics, interactive installation, and computational
            architecture.  Previous projects include exhibiting a light-enhanced
            sculpture (Tampa Public Mood Ring), a cartographic Rorschach
            generator for Turbulence.org’s Net Art Commission (Invisible
            Influenced), and experimental fabrication research involving carbon
            fibre architectural composites.  In addition, he has taught students
            of computer science, fine arts and architecture in the US and in the

            “Serving sounds” - A listening session and compositional workshop
            with Ekheo The server room is a place carrying other seemingly
            endless digital spaces. We can experience it as a trace of online
            files and data it stores. How does this mysteriously layered space
            sound? Is there a way to give it a sonic materiality through the way
            we listen to it? This is what we would like to attempt with you in
            this workshop. Divided in two parts, we will do a guided listening
            session in the morning and produce a collective sonic composition in
            the afternoon. <br />
            What do you need? For the morning listening session: Paper and pens
            of your choice For the Afternoon production session: A computer with
            a DAW and headphones (audacity is free for mac and windows)
