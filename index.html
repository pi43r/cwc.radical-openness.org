          Conversations with Computers is a 2-day Symposium organized by the net
          culture initiative servus.at in cooperation with the Department of
          Time-based Media of the University of Art and Design Linz. The
          symposium addresses contemporary artistic research in the field of AI,
          focusing on new languages that emerge between humans and machines, but
          also how work and communication are facilitated through technological
          means. The discursive event is accompanied by two workshops and an
          exhibition of artistic works produced during the
          <a href="/siliconfriendcamp/">Silicon Friends Camp</a>, a 5-days
          retreat with 15 artists in the austrian alps that took place last
          summer.

          Conversations with Computers is a 2-day Symposium organized by the net
          culture initiative servus.at in cooperation with the Department of
          Time-based Media of the University of Art and Design Linz. The
          symposium addresses contemporary artistic research in the field of AI,
          focusing on new languages that emerge between humans and machines, but
          also how work and communication are facilitated through technological
          means.
          <br />
          When we talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning today,
          we must not forget the enormous amount of human labor that is hidden
          in seemingly autonomous systems. Behind every computer program are an
          immense amount of people who make it possible, and whose presence, in
          most cases, stays hidden behind the interface. Moreover, these AI
          systems are built upon an extractivist logic that inherits and
          reproduces harmful social biases in their statistical weights.
          Artists, critical designers, and researchers are playing a central
          role in excavating AI systems by exposing the work that flows into the
          creation of large datasets and their refinement. <br />
          By stepping back and exploring the codes and symbols we use to create
          instructions for machines, artists and programmers are fundamentally
          questioning the desire for efficiency embedded within the act of
          programming computers. What is discussed under the label of 'Esoteric
          programming languages' breaks away from the norms of computing and
          create novel languages and styles with strange syntax and twisted
          logic. Within these fringes of programming languages, we can find a
          desire to untangle and obfuscate the building blocks of human-computer
          interaction, while critical code studies are articulating discourse
          around feminist, decolonial, indigenous, and queer approaches to AI
          and the Human. <br />
          With forthcoming large language models, new conversational agents are
          emerging, which distill scraped websites into stochastic parrots. They
          lead to advancements, which enable more natural forms of interaction
          between humans and computers. <br />
          A look into the future suggests that we will soon be living with
          anthropomorphized computers, which are designed with an obedient
          personality that mimics empathy and emotion. Current models of voice
          computer interfaces already simulate personalities to gain a user’s
          trust. Designers are optimizing for approachability, efficiency, and
          by all means, to avoid friction. Yet, at the fringes of computation,
          we can find points of friction, and exploitation, but also new
          experiments and poetic communication. <br />
          Taking examples from esolangs and analytical design practices, how do
          we envision new critical interfaces between humans and machines? How
          do we navigate through our increasingly computational environments
          with our silicon-based friends?
